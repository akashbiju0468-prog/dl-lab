ðŸ“Œ Objective of the Study

The main objective of this study is to classify handwritten digits (0â€“9) from the MNIST dataset using a deep learning model.
It aims to demonstrate how an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) can be applied for image recognition tasks.

ðŸ“Š Dataset Used and Its Description
Dataset: MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology)
Type: Image dataset
Size:
Training data: 60,000 grayscale images
Testing data: 10,000 grayscale images
Image size: 28 Ã— 28 pixels (each pixel has a value between 0 and 255)
Classes: 10 (digits from 0 to 9)
The dataset is preloaded in TensorFlow/Keras, making it widely used for benchmarking image classification models.

ðŸ§  Deep Learning Method Applied
The model is a Sequential Artificial Neural Network (ANN):
Input Layer: Flatten layer (converts 28Ã—28 image â†’ 784 features).
Hidden Layers:
Dense(128, ReLU activation)
Dense(64, ReLU activation)
Output Layer: Dense(10, Softmax activation) for classification into 10 classes.
Optimizer: Adam
Loss Function: Categorical Crossentropy
Metrics: Accuracy
Training Parameters:
Epochs: 10
Batch size: 32

ðŸ“ˆ Results / Output
The model is trained for 10 epochs with validation on test data.
Example expected results:
Training Accuracy â†’ ~97â€“98%
Test Accuracy â†’ ~96â€“97%
print(f'Test accuracy: {test_acc}') gives the final accuracy.
So, the model achieves high accuracy in digit classification.

âœ… Conclusion

This study successfully demonstrates the application of Deep Learning (ANN) in recognizing handwritten digits.
The MNIST dataset is an ideal benchmark, and the model achieves over 96% test accuracy with just two hidden layers.
Such models are a foundation for more complex tasks like OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and real-time number plate recognition.
